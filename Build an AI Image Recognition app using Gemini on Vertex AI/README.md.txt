1] open terminal; create a file and save it as genai.py

2] opy and paste the provided code snippet into your file.

from google import genai
from google.genai.types import HttpOptions, Part

client = genai.Client(http_options=HttpOptions(api_version="v1"))
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
    contents=[
        "What is shown in this image?",
        Part.from_uri(
            file_uri="gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/image/scones.jpg",
            mime_type="image/jpeg",
        ),
    ],
)
print(response.text)

3]To set the environment variables in the new terminal, run the following command:

export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT='qwiklabs-gcp-03-0bdff506932d'
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION='us-central1'
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=True

4]Execute the Python file by invoking the below command inside the terminal within the Code Editor pane to view the output.

/usr/bin/python3 /genai.py

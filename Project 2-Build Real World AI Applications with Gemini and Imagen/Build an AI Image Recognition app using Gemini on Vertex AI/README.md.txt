Code Explanation
The code snippet is loading a pre-trained AI model called ImageGenerationModel (imagen-3.0-generate-002) on Vertex AI.
The code calls the generate_image method of the loaded Gemini model.
The input to the method is a text prompt.
The code uses Gemini's ability to understand the text prompt and use it to build an AI Image.
